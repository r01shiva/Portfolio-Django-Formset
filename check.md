Create a website to convert your CV/Resume into a personal portfolio website to be used for seeking industrial training opportunities and help with your placements.

1. Have different sections, dedicated to aspects of your resume (academics, co-curricular, projects, internships, trainings, seminars, awards, publications, etc)
2. Should have a sign in for yourself to allow you to edit things dynamically. (figure this out on your own for the time being)
3. Site should be dynamically editable by the logged in user. 
    (ex. you can add data to a particular section when you have a update worth making on the cv.)
1. Site should be a single pager. and optimized for responsive devices
2. Site should be printable, specifically formatted version for colored and greyscale printing.

Methodology: (Estimated avg. timeline 3 Weeks.)

1. Do your research by selecting at least 2 personal portfolio websites and stating the best parts about the site.
2. Submit a design draft before you start working on the programming parts. (use power-point or google slides if you donâ€™t have a prototyping software)
3. Design the data keeping in mind the JavaScript Object structure.
4. Submit data schema and get it approved.
5. Build the project code
